# Turtle Race Game

Welcome to the Turtle Race Game repository! This Python script uses the `turtle` graphics library to simulate a fun and interactive turtle racing game. Players can bet on which colored turtle they think will win the race, and then watch as the turtles race towards the finish line.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. This script is compatible with Python 3.x versions. If Python is not already installed, you can download and install it from here:

[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

To get started with this project, you can clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a zip file. Use the following command to clone it using Git:

```

## Running the Script

To run the game, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute the following command in your terminal:

```
python3 turtle_race_game.py
```
A graphical window will open asking you to make a bet on a turtle's color. After placing your bet, the race will start. You will see a series of turtles racing towards the finish line. The concole will print a message indicating whether you won or lost based on your bet.

## Game Features

Colorful Interface: Six turtles, each with a unique color, compete in the race.
User Interaction: Before the race starts, you're prompted to enter a bet on which color turtle you think will win.
Random Movement: Each turtle moves a random distance forward in each round, making the race outcomes unpredictable.
